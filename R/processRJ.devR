#'
#' This is just a list of ideas for functions to help process RJ outputs.

#' 1) Calculate mean branch lengths for the posterior of scaled trees.

#' 2) Plot those mean branch lengths against the branch lengths of the tree that I simulated the data on.

#' 3) Show how frequently each node had a scalar applied to it.
